 This dataset is drawn from 300,000 primary physician visits in Brazil across 2014 and 2015. The information about the appointment was automatically coded when the patient scheduled the appointment and then the patient was marked as having either attended or not. The information about the appointment included demographic data, time data, and conditions concerning the reason for the visit.
